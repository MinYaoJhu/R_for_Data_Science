"0","#|   A scatterplot of body mass vs. flipper length of penguins, with a "
"0","#|   line of best fit displaying the relationship between these two variables "
"0","#|   overlaid. The plot displays a positive, fairly linear, and relatively "
"0","#|   strong relationship between these two variables. Species (Adelie, "
"0","#|   Chinstrap, and Gentoo) are represented with different colors and "
"0","#|   shapes. The relationship between body mass and flipper length is "
"0","#|   roughly the same for these three species, and Gentoo penguins are "
"0","#|   larger than penguins from the other two species."
