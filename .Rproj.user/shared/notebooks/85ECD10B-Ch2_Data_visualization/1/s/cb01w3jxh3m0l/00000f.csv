"0","#|   A scatterplot of body mass vs. flipper length of penguins. The plot "
"0","#|   displays a positive, linear, relatively strong relationship between "
"0","#|   these two variables. The points are colored based on the species of the "
"0","#|   penguins and the shapes of the points represent islands (round points are "
"0","#|   Biscoe island, triangles are Dream island, and squared are Torgersen "
"0","#|   island). The plot is very busy and it's difficult to distinguish the shapes"
"0","#|   of the points."
